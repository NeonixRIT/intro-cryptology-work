Step 1. Append padding bits
Step 2. Append length
Step 3. Initialize MD buffer
Step 4. Process message in 16-word blocks
Step 5. Output

Step 1. Append padding bits
    The message is "padded" (extended) so that its length (in bits)
    is congruent to 448, modulo 512.  That is, the message is
    extended so that it is just 64 bits shy of being a multiple of
    512 bits long.  Padding is always performed, even if the length
    of the message is already congruent to 448, modulo 512 (in
    which case 512 bits of padding are added).
    Padding is performed as follows: a single "1" bit is appended
    to the message, and then enough zero bits are appended so that
    the length in bits of the padded message becomes congruent to
    448, modulo 512.

Step 2. Append length
    A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before
    the padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the
    previous step.  In the unlikely event that b is greater than
    2^64, then only the low-order 64 bits of b are used.  (These
    bits are appended as two 32-bit words and appended low-order
    word first in accordance with the previous conventions.)

    At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits
    and with b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits.
    Equivalently, this message has a length that is an exact
    multiple of 16 (32-bit) words.  Let M[0 ... N-1] denote the
    words of the resulting message, where N is a multiple of 16.

Step 3. Initialize MD buffer
    A 4-word buffer (A,B,C,D) is used to compute the message
    digest.  Here each of A,B,C,D are 32-bit registers.  These
    registers are initialized to the following values in
    hexadecimal, low-order bytes first):

    word A:    01 23 45 67
    word B:    89 ab cd ef
    word C:    fe dc ba 98
    word D:    76 54 32 10

Step 4. Process message in 16-word blocks
    We first define three auxiliary functions that each take
    as input three 32-bit words and produce as output one
    32-bit word.

    f(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v not(X)Z
    g(X,Y,Z)  =  XY v XZ v YZ
    h(X,Y,Z)  =  X xor Y xor Z

    In each bit position f acts as a conditional: if x then y else
    z.  (The function f could have been defined using + instead of
    v since XY and not(X)Z will never have 1's in the same bit
    position.)  In each bit position g acts as a majority function:
    if at least two of x, y, z are on, then g has a one in that bit
    position, else g has a zero. It is interesting to note that if
    the bits of X, Y, and Z are independent and unbiased, the each
    bit of f(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased, and similarly
    each bit of g(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased.  The
    function h is the bit-wise "xor" or "parity" function; it has
    properties similar to those of f and g.

    Do the following:

    For i = 0 to N/16-1 do  /* process each 16-word block */
            For j = 0 to 15 do: /* copy block i into X */
                Set X[j] to M[i*16+j].
            end /* of loop on j */
            Save A as AA, B as BB, C as CC, and D as DD.

    (That is, each of the four registers is incremented by
    the value it had before this block was started.)

    end /* of loop on i */

Step 5. Output
    The message digest produced as output is A,B,C,D.  That is, we
    begin with the low-order byte of A, and end with the high-order
    byte of D.

    This completes the description of MD4.  A reference
    implementation in C is given in the Appendix.
